# Advanced higher Computing science project 2019-2020
## Project proposal 
I intend to develop a program based around the classic game Pac-man. The game will include a maze where the user plays as Pac-man who tries to collect points whilst running from the ghosts. If the user collides with a ghost, a life will be lost, and the game will continue. If the user runs out of lives, the game will end and the users name, entered before the game starts, and score will be added to an external high scores database. The game will feature a menu screen which will have buttons linking to an instructions page, the high scores table, and the user-name input/start game screen. </br>
The game will feature three levels of increasing difficulty which the user will be able to work through. The user will be able to view a high scores table which will be generated using the bubble search algorithm.</br>
The project is coded in Python using Object Oriented principles</br>
